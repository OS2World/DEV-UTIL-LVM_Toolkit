This directory contains two sample programs which demonstrate the usage of the
LVM Toolkit.  They are both written in C/C++ and have been tested successfully
with the IBM VisualAge C++ compilers.


LVMTEST is the original LVM sample program written by John Martin Alfredsson
(who originally arranged the toolkit files).  Run LVMTEST.CMD to compile.


QUERYLVM is a more extensive sample program written by Alex Taylor.  It uses a
makefile instead of a batch file to build; run 'nmake' to compile (assuming you
are using the IBM C Compiler).
